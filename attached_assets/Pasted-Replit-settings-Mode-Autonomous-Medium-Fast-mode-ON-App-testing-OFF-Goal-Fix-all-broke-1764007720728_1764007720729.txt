Goal:
Fix all broken Tailwind CSS class strings where a literal `...` has ended up inside the className, which is preventing gradient/background/spacing utilities from applying correctly.

This is a PURELY VISUAL cleanup:
- Do NOT change any component logic, data fetching, or backend code.
- Do NOT rename components or change routes.
- Only fix invalid className strings.

Context:
- Project: Certia (RightToWorkDE).
- Tech: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn UI in `client/src`.
- I recently did a visual polish pass and some Tailwind classes got truncated into things like:
  - `bg-gradient-to-r from-primary...ckground to-background`
  - `h-7 w-7 rounded-lg ... from-primary/20 to-primary/5`
  - `bg-gradient-to-br...er justify-center`
- These `...` fragments break the utilities and make gradients / icon pills / logo background look “off”.

==================================================
TASK 1 — Find and fix all `...` inside className strings
==================================================

1) Search the **client-side code** (especially under `client/src/pages` and `client/src/components`) for:
   - Any `className` (or `class`) string literals that contain a literal `...`.

   Examples of what to look for:
   - `"bg-gradient-to-r from-primary...ckground to-background"`
   - `"h-7 w-7 rounded-lg ... from-primary/20 to-primary/5"`
   - `"bg-gradient-to-br...er justify-center"`
   - Or any similar pattern where `...` appears inside a quoted Tailwind class string.

2) For each occurrence:
   - Replace the broken className with a valid Tailwind sequence that matches the intended design.
   - Preserve the original intent (gradients, layout, alignment), for example:

   - Example fixes (adapt exact values to the surrounding styles):

     - Broken:
       - `bg-gradient-to-r from-primary...ckground to-background`
       - Fix to something like:
       - `bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/10 via-background to-background`

     - Broken:
       - `h-7 w-7 rounded-lg ... from-primary/20 to-primary/5`
       - Fix to:
       - `h-7 w-7 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/20 to-primary/5 flex items-center justify-center`

     - Broken:
       - `bg-gradient-to-br...er justify-center`
       - Fix to:
       - `bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/20 to-primary/5 flex items-center justify-center`

   - Use consistent Tailwind utilities the project already uses:
     - `bg-gradient-to-r`, `bg-gradient-to-br`
     - `from-primary/10`, `from-primary/20`, `to-primary/5`, `to-background`
     - `flex items-center justify-center`
     - No need to invent a new visual style; just “restore” what clearly was meant.

3) IMPORTANT:
   - Only treat `...` as broken when it appears **inside a string literal** used for className/class.
   - Do NOT touch legitimate JavaScript/TypeScript spread syntax (e.g. `{...props}`).
   - Do NOT remove or alter any conditional class logic (e.g. `clsx`, `cn` helpers). Just fix the literal strings being passed in.

==================================================
TASK 2 — Focus on key components where this likely appears
==================================================

Make sure you check (non-exhaustive list, but high priority):

- Landing page hero + preview card:
  - `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
  - Any stat/metric cards or icon pills on this page.

- Global/logo components:
  - `client/src/components/CertiaLogo.tsx` (or similar):
    - Ensure the logo’s gradient background and alignment classes are valid (no `...`).

- Dashboard metric cards and icon badges:
  - `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`
  - Any small icon containers with gradients or rounded backgrounds.

- Any shared header or PageHeader component:
  - `client/src/components/PageHeader.tsx` (or equivalent):
    - Check for gradient backgrounds on the header container.

If you find `...` in other className strings, fix them in the same way.

==================================================
TASK 3 — Sanity check & constraints
==================================================

- Do NOT modify:
  - Any APIs, routes, or backend files.
  - Any business logic, OCR logic, Venice AI logic, or rules engine code.
- Only correct invalid Tailwind class strings.

After fixes:
- Run the dev server and visually confirm that:
  - Landing hero gradients and stat cards look smooth and intentional.
  - The Certia logo has a proper gradient background and is centered.
  - Dashboard metric cards and icon badges show the expected gradient/tinted backgrounds.
- Keep your summary of changes very short (≤3 bullets), describing only which components had their classNames fixed.
