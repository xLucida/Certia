Replit settings:
- Mode: Autonomous – Medium
- App testing: ON
- Fast mode: OFF

Goal:
Improve the PUBLIC upload experience (candidate-facing) for Certia so it feels more trustworthy and “real product” level:
1) Clear “how your data is used” explainer.
2) A reference code + file summary after successful upload.

Scope:
- Frontend only for the public upload page.
- Use existing backend response data (e.g. checkId, any upload result info) – do NOT change backend routes in this prompt.
- Keep all changes additive and copy/UX focused.

Context:
- Public upload page lives in something like `client/src/pages/public-upload.tsx`.
- It already:
  - Accepts 1–5 files.
  - Shows selected file names.
  - Calls `/api/public-upload/submit`.
  - Shows a success state when upload completes.

==================================================
TASK 1 — “How your data is used” explainer (before upload)
==================================================

1) On the public upload page, inside the main card shown BEFORE upload, add a small “How your data is used” block.

- Content (adapt text to match the rest of the tone, but keep the meaning):

  - Heading (small): “How your data is used”
  - Paragraph:
    - “Your documents are securely sent to your prospective employer via Certia.”
  - Bullets (or short sentences):
    - “They are only used to perform a right-to-work check for Germany.”
    - “Documents are transmitted over an encrypted connection.”
    - “This upload link is time-limited and cannot be reused once expired.”

- If the token / backend already includes the employer/company name, you may show:
  - “You’re sending these documents to [EmployerName] via Certia.”
  - If that info is not easily available, stick to “your prospective employer”.

2) Make sure this block is visually subtle but clear:
   - Use `text-sm` and `text-muted-foreground`.
   - Place it under the main explanation text and above the dropzone.

==================================================
TASK 2 — Success screen: reference code + file summary
==================================================

Goal:
After successful upload, give the candidate a clear confirmation they can reference later.

1) On successful upload, the page already shows a success state (message like “Thank you – your documents have been received.”). Extend this:

- Add a “Reference code” line, e.g.:

  - “Reference code: CERTIA-XXXXXX”

- Implementation detail:
  - If the upload response already contains a checkId or similar ID, derive this from it.
    - e.g. `CERTIA-` + first 8 characters of the check ID.
  - If the exact field name is different, search the existing success-state code and reuse whatever identifier is returned from `/api/public-upload/submit`.
  - If no identifier is available at all, generate a short random code on the client and show it as a local reference (but prefer using the real checkId if available).

2) Show a short summary of what was uploaded:

- Example:

  - “Uploaded documents (3):”
  - List:
    - `bluecard_front.pdf`
    - `bluecard_back.jpg`
    - `registration.pdf`

- Use the same `selectedFiles` / upload result structure already in state (you should be able to reuse filenames from the existing code).

3) Keep copy consistent with the rest of the app’s tone. Example final success block:

- “Thank you — your documents have been received.”
- “Reference code: CERTIA-AB12CD34”
- “Uploaded documents (3): [file list]”
- “Your prospective employer will review them and contact you if anything else is needed.”

==================================================
Constraints & sanity checks
==================================================

- Do NOT change:
  - Any API routes.
  - OCR/AI logic.
  - Public-upload backend behavior.
- Only modify the public upload page’s UI and use existing response data.
- Confirm:
  - Single-file and multi-file uploads still work.
  - Success state shows a reference code and file list.
  - The “How your data is used” block displays correctly before upload.
- Keep explanation comments short and focused.
