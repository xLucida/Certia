Replit settings:
- Autonomy: Autonomous – Medium
- App testing: OFF (copy + frontend only)

Goal:
Rename the product from “RTW-DE” to “Certia” and update key marketing copy to reflect the new brand, without changing any backend logic or database schema.

General instructions:
- FRONTEND ONLY: modify React/Tailwind/client files and static text. Do NOT touch server code, lib/rightToWork.ts, lib/ocr.ts, or schema/migrations.
- Be minimal and precise. Only change text/labels and, if needed, minor layout to accommodate new copy.
- Keep all routes, components, and behavior identical.

Tasks:

1) Brand rename:
- Replace visible “RTW-DE” branding in:
  - App header / top-left logo
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Browser <title> / meta where applicable
- New name: “Certia”
- Where space allows (e.g., sidebar under logo), add a small subtitle: “Right-to-work for Germany”.

2) Landing hero copy:
- H1: “Right-to-Work Clarity for Germany”
- Subheadline: “Manage work eligibility, visa documents, and expiries in one place. Upload German residence permits and get a clear, structured right-to-work decision for every employee.”
- Primary CTA button text: “Get Started with Certia”.
- Update the four feature cards descriptions to:
  - Document Management: “Store and organize all visa and work-permit documents in one secure workspace.”
  - Automated Checks: “Turn German residence documents into structured right-to-work decisions with clear reasons.”
  - Expiry Alerts: “See which documents are expiring soon and act before work authorization lapses.”
  - Stay Compliant: “Give HR a simple system to monitor work eligibility and document history over time.”
- “Simplified HR Compliance” section:
  - Title: “Simplified Right-to-Work Compliance”
  - Body: “Certia helps HR teams manage right-to-work compliance for employees in Germany. Track EU Blue Cards, EAT permits, Fiktionsbescheinigungen, and other residence titles with automated eligibility checks, audit-friendly history, and expiry monitoring.”

3) Dashboard description:
- Under the main “Dashboard” heading, add or update a short description line:
  - “Overview of employees, right-to-work checks, and upcoming visa expiries.”
- Ensure metric cards still read:
  - Total employees: “Active employee records”
  - Eligible workers: “Currently authorized to work”
  - Expiring soon: “Documents expiring within 60 days”

4) Footer:
- Change any footer text:
  - From: “© 2024 RTW-DE. All rights reserved.”
  - To:   “© 2024 Certia. All rights reserved.”
- If there is a tagline line, use: “Certia – right-to-work clarity for German HR.”

Constraints:
- Do NOT alter any API calls, enums, or internal identifiers named RTW-DE in code unless they are purely visual labels. If unsure, leave them as-is.
- Do NOT change environment variables or database names.
- Keep all layout responsive and aligned after copy changes.
