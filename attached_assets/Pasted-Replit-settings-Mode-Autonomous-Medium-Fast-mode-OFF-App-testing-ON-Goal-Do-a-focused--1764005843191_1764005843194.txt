Replit settings:
- Mode: Autonomous – Medium
- Fast mode: OFF
- App testing: ON

Goal:
Do a focused UI/UX polish pass on Certia’s core internal screens so it feels closer to Stripe/Coinbase quality:
- Premium but calm visuals.
- Very clear hierarchy and layout.
- Consistent page headers and spacing.
- NO changes to backend, OCR, AI, or business logic.

Scope:
Only touch these frontend files (and any new shared component you introduce):
- client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx
- client/src/pages/check-detail.tsx
- client/src/pages/employee-detail.tsx
- client/src/pages/check-new.tsx (lightly, to align with the new pattern)
- client/src/components (for a new shared PageHeader component if useful)

Global constraints:
- Do NOT change any API routes, schemas, or business logic.
- Do NOT change how data is fetched or mutated.
- Do NOT touch server-side files in this prompt.
- Keep all existing tests, print views, and behaviors intact.
- This is a visual/layout pass only: Tailwind classNames, component structure, and small new presentational components.

==================================================
TASK 1 — Introduce a shared <PageHeader> component
==================================================

Create a new component, for example:
- File: client/src/components/PageHeader.tsx

This component should:
- Accept props like:
  - title: string
  - kicker?: string   // small all-caps label above the title (e.g. “Dashboard”, “Employee”, “Check”)
  - description?: string
  - icon?: React.ReactNode
  - actions?: React.ReactNode   // right-aligned buttons/filters
- Layout:
  - Full-width header block with:
    - Left side: kicker (small, muted), big title, and description.
    - Optional icon to the left of the text (small, subtle).
  - Right side: actions row (e.g. primary / secondary buttons).
- Visual style:
  - Use the existing design tokens (primary, muted, etc.).
  - Add a subtle gradient/soft background behind the header (e.g. bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/5 via-background to-background, rounded-xl, border, etc.).
  - Spacing similar to: `py-4 md:py-6 px-4 md:px-6`.

We’ll use this header on the core pages below.

==================================================
TASK 2 — Dashboard: reorganize into a calm “control room”
==================================================

File: client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx

1) At the top of the main content (inside the `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-8` container), replace the existing ad-hoc heading block with the new <PageHeader>:

- Kicker: “Dashboard”
- Title: “Right-to-work cockpit”
- Description (something like):
  - “Monitor expiring documents, review flagged checks, and keep your German workforce compliant.”
- Actions: the main “Add employee” / “New check” / “Export CSV” buttons that already exist on this page (reuse existing buttons, don’t add new flows).

2) Below the PageHeader, refine the layout:

- Use a consistent `space-y-6` or `space-y-8` vertical rhythm.
- Keep the top metrics row as a `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`, but:
  - Ensure all metric cards share consistent height and padding.
  - Add subtle hover: e.g. `hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition-all` and a very light gradient or border accent.
  - Use bolder numbers and smaller labels for cleaner hierarchy.

- For the main tables/cards below:
  - Group “Cases requiring review” and “Expiring documents” into a 2-column layout on desktop:
    - Something like `grid grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-6`, with:
      - Left: 2 columns wide (queue / main table).
      - Right: 1 column wide (expiring docs card + maybe recent checks stacked).
  - On small screens, it should still stack naturally (single column).

The aim: when HR lands here, their eye flows:
PageHeader → top metrics → review queue → expiring docs.

Do NOT change any of the filtering logic, search, or how rows are built; just reorganize JSX and classNames.

==================================================
TASK 3 — Check Detail: 2-column “case workspace”
==================================================

File: client/src/pages/check-detail.tsx

1) Wrap the main non-print content in a responsive 2-column layout:

- Keep the existing print header exactly as-is.
- For the main content (currently using a stacked Card layout), refactor so that:

  - Use a container like:
    - `<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-8 space-y-6 print:px-0 print:py-0">`
  - Immediately inside, render a <PageHeader> at the top (visible in normal view, hidden when printing):
    - Kicker: “Check”
    - Title: Something like “Right-to-work check”
    - Description: Derived from the check if available, e.g. employee or candidate name + document info.
    - Actions: the existing Print + Delete buttons, plus any other primary actions.

2) Below the PageHeader, create a grid:

- Something like: `grid grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-[minmax(0,_1.7fr)_minmax(0,_1.2fr)] gap-6 print:block`.
- Left column (decision-focused):
  - The core Card with:
    - Check metadata (ID, created date, case status select).
    - Work status badge.
    - `CheckDecisionPanel` (summary + details).
    - `StatusInterpretation` / missing information block.
  - This should read from top to bottom as “Everything you need to know about the decision.”

- Right column (record-focused), using Cards:
  - Attachments (upload drop zone + list).
  - Notes (add note + history).
  - Recent activity (audit logs).

3) Visual polish:
- Make sure cards use consistent paddings and headings (e.g. `CardTitle` with `text-base` or `text-lg`).
- Add subtle separators between sections inside a card using `border-t` and `pt-4` where helpful.
- Keep all print behavior:
  - The print view should still show the audit header and main decision content; it’s fine if the 2-column layout collapses to single column when printing.

Do not change any mutations, fetches, or case-status logic. Only reorganize JSX and Tailwind classes.

==================================================
TASK 4 — Employee Detail: profile + timeline
==================================================

File: client/src/pages/employee-detail.tsx

1) Replace the top h1/heading section with <PageHeader>:

- Kicker: “Employee”
- Title: “{FirstName} {LastName}”
- Description:
  - Include optional info if available, e.g. date of birth or internal employee ID.
- Actions:
  - “Print Employee Audit Report”, “Generate upload link”, and the existing Edit/Delete buttons.

2) Below the header, restructure the main content into two areas:

- Use something like `space-y-6` for overall layout.
- Add a 2-column grid on desktop: `grid grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-[minmax(0,_1.6fr)_minmax(0,_1.1fr)] gap-6`.

Left column:
- The card showing:
  - Latest status (StatusBadge).
  - Next expiry (big date + “in X days” badge).
- The card listing all checks for this employee (table or list). This is the “timeline” of checks.

Right column:
- Any summary cards (e.g. key info, quick links).
- The “generate upload link” block.
- Any helpful small cards (e.g. quick actions, tips).

3) Ensure on small screens it still stacks vertically and remains readable.

Do not change the logic for how checks are sorted or how the upload link is generated; only layout and styling.

==================================================
TASK 5 — New Check page: align with the new visual language
==================================================

File: client/src/pages/check-new.tsx

1) At the top of the page container, add a <PageHeader>:

- Kicker: “New check”
- Title: “Create right-to-work check”
- Description:
  - “Upload the document, review the extracted details, then confirm and save the check.”

2) Keep the existing stepper and cards, but:
- Ensure the spacing and headings feel consistent with the new design:
  - Use similar `space-y`, `Card` paddings, and typography as the upgraded Dashboard / Check Detail pages.
- Slightly reduce visual noise:
  - Prefer fewer borders and more whitespace where possible.
  - Ensure the most important actions (upload, save) stand out.

Do not change any of the step logic, validations, or OCR behavior.

==================================================
Final constraints and checks
==================================================

- NO backend / server / schema / rules engine changes.
- NO new routes or flows.
- Do not remove existing functionality (print, delete, notes, attachments, status changes, etc.).
- Keep print views working; it’s OK if the print layout is single-column.
- Focus purely on:
  - Consistent PageHeader usage.
  - Cleaner layout and spacing.
  - Better grouping of content (decision vs record).
  - Subtle visual polish (hover, gradients, typography).

At the end, summarize in ≤5 bullets what changed visually on:
- Dashboard
- Check detail
- Employee detail
- New check
