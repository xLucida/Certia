Build a small SaaS MVP called **RTW-DE** (Right-To-Work Germany) for HR teams.

Goal: Let an HR user:
- Sign up / log in
- Create Employees
- Create Right-to-Work checks for each employee
- See a dashboard of employees + work status + upcoming expiries

Use:
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Any simple SQL DB supported on Replit (SQLite/Postgres) + an ORM (Prisma if easy)
- Basic email/password auth

Data models (adapt if needed):

User:
- id, name, email, password_hash, companyName, createdAt, updatedAt

Employee:
- id, userId, firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, notes, createdAt, updatedAt

RightToWorkCheck:
- id, employeeId
- documentType (EU_BLUE_CARD | EAT | FIKTIONSBESCHEINIGUNG | OTHER)
- documentNumber
- countryOfIssue
- dateOfIssue
- expiryDate
- workStatus (ELIGIBLE | NOT_ELIGIBLE | NEEDS_REVIEW)
- decisionSummary (short string)
- decisionDetails (longer text)
- createdAt, updatedAt

Main features:

1. Auth: simple email/password sign-up and login.

2. Employees:
   - List employees belonging to the logged-in user
   - Create/edit employees

3. New Right-to-Work check:
   - Select or create an employee
   - Form fields: documentType, documentNumber, countryOfIssue, dateOfIssue, expiryDate
   - Optional file upload (PDF/image) saved somewhere simple (e.g., /uploads or storage)
   - On submit, call a small rules function to determine status:

Rules (hard-code logic):
- EU_BLUE_CARD or EAT:
  - if expiryDate > now → ELIGIBLE
  - else → NOT_ELIGIBLE
- FIKTIONSBESCHEINIGUNG:
  - if expiryDate > now → NEEDS_REVIEW
  - else → NOT_ELIGIBLE
- OTHER: always NEEDS_REVIEW

The rules function should live in a separate TypeScript helper, e.g.:

evaluateRightToWork({ documentType, expiryDate }) => { workStatus, decisionSummary, decisionDetails }

4. Dashboard:
   - After login, show:
     - Table of employees and their latest check:
       - employee name
       - documentType
       - workStatus (with colored badge)
       - expiryDate
       - link to a detail page
   - Section for “expiring soon”: checks with expiryDate in the next 60 days.

5. OCR stub:
   - Add a helper like `extractFieldsFromDocument(file)` that currently just returns mock data and has a TODO comment where I can plug in a real OCR API later.

Design:
- Keep styling simple, clean and responsive using Tailwind.
- Include a short README explaining how to run the app and where to plug in a real OCR API.
