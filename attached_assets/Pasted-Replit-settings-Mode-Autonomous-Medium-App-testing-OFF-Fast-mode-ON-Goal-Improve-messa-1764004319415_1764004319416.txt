Goal:
Improve messaging and perceived polish by:
1) Splitting the Help page into clear HR-facing help vs technical diagnostics.
2) Sharpening the landing page hero copy with a clear promise for HR + compliance.

Scope:
- Frontend copy/layout only.
- No backend or data changes.

Context:
- Help page: `client/src/pages/help.tsx`.
  - Currently mixes HR FAQ and a technical diagnostics section for OCR/AI/rules.
- Landing page: `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` (or equivalent).
  - Already has a hero section with headline, subheading, and feature bullets.

==================================================
TASK 1 — Help page: separate “Help” from “Diagnostics”
==================================================

1) On the Help page:

- Keep the existing HR-facing FAQ content visible by default.
- Move the **technical diagnostics** (raw OCR text, Venice/rules test, JSON output, etc.) into a clearly labeled “Advanced” section.

2) Implementation options (choose the simplest consistent with the codebase):

- Option A: Collapsible section:

  - Add a section heading like “Advanced: Technical diagnostics (for admins)”.
  - Put the existing diagnostics UI (textarea, test button, JSON output) inside a collapsible component or a simple `Accordion` / `Collapsible` / `details`-like component.
  - Default state: collapsed.

- Option B: Tabs:

  - If you already use tabs (e.g. shadcn Tabs component), split content into:
    - Tab 1: “Help & FAQ”
    - Tab 2: “Technical diagnostics”
  - Place the diagnostics UI in the second tab.

3) Add a short line at the top of the diagnostics section:

- Example:
  - “This area is intended for admins or technical users to test OCR and AI configuration. HR users can ignore this section in normal use.”

==================================================
TASK 2 — Landing hero: explicit promise for HR & compliance
==================================================

1) On the landing page hero section:

- Update the main headline + subheading to clearly target German HR/compliance, for example:

  - Headline (example wording; refine to match tone):
    - “Right-to-work checks for German HR teams, documented and audit-ready.”
  - Subheading:
    - “Certia helps you standardize right-to-work checks, log every decision, and stay audit-ready in minutes — without turning your team into immigration experts.”

2) Under the hero text, refine the feature bullets to emphasize:

- “Documented decisions (printable reports and CSV exports).”
- “AI + rules engine that defaults to ‘Needs review’ when unsure.”
- “Complete audit trail: notes, attachments, and case workflow.”

You don’t need to add lots of new bullets; just tune the existing ones so at least 2–3 explicitly speak to:

- Standardization
- Auditability / compliance
- Safety (conservative defaults)

3) Keep layout, buttons, and hero preview card as they are; only adjust copy.

==================================================
Constraints & checks
==================================================

- Do NOT change any logic or APIs.
- Only update Help page layout and landing text.
- Confirm:
  - Help page still shows FAQ clearly and hides “scary” technical bits from casual HR users by default.
  - Landing page feels clearly targeted at HR/compliance for German right-to-work use-cases.
- Keep explanations in your summary to a few bullet points.
