Goal:
Make Certia feel more “pilot-ready” for first-time HR users:
1) A “Getting started” card on the dashboard when there’s no data.
2) A TL;DR line in the employees list summarizing the latest check for each employee.

Scope:
- Frontend only (dashboard + employees list pages).
- Only use existing data that’s already being fetched.
- No backend changes in this prompt.

Context:
- Dashboard page: `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` (or similar).
- Employees list page: `client/src/pages/employees.tsx` (or wherever employees are listed).
- You already have:
  - Employee + latest check data on the dashboard and/or employees page.
  - On each employee, `latestCheck` with fields like `workStatus`, `documentType`, `expiryDate`, and `decisionSummary`.

==================================================
TASK 1 — Dashboard “Getting started” card (first-time UX)
==================================================

1) On the dashboard page:

- Detect a “first-time” or “empty” state:
  - Condition: when there are no employees AND no checks.
    - You can derive this from arrays already being rendered (e.g., `employees.length === 0` and `standaloneChecks.length === 0` or their equivalents).

2) When the empty condition is true:

- Render a prominent card at the top of the main dashboard content:

  Suggested content:

  - Title: “Getting started with Certia”
  - Subtitle (small): “Follow these steps to create your first right-to-work check.”
  - A simple 3-step list:

    1. “Add an employee” — with a button linking to the existing “Add employee” flow.
    2. “Send them an upload link” — with a button or text referring to generating an upload link from the employee detail page.
    3. “Review the check” — explaining that new checks will appear on the dashboard and employee pages.

- Use existing Card components and icons (e.g. lucide icons) to keep styling consistent.

3) When there IS data (employees or checks exist):

- Hide the “Getting started” card completely so it doesn’t clutter the dashboard long-term.

==================================================
TASK 2 — Employees list: TL;DR line for latest check
==================================================

1) On the employees list page:

- For each employee row, you already have access to their latest check (or can easily add it, as the dashboard already uses `latestCheck`).

2) Under or next to the employee name, add a small TL;DR line summarizing their latest check:

- Format something like:

  - If there is a latest check:

    - “Last check: ELIGIBLE — EU Blue Card, expires 12.04.2026”
    - OR
    - “Last check: NEEDS REVIEW — missing employer information”

  - Use:

    - `workStatus` (ELIGIBLE / NOT_ELIGIBLE / NEEDS_REVIEW)
    - `documentType` (converted to human-friendly text if needed).
    - `expiryDate` (formatted date).
    - A short version of `decisionSummary` (or nothing if that’s too long).

- If no check exists for that employee:
  - Show something like:
    - “No right-to-work checks yet.”

3) Styling:

- Keep the TL;DR line subtle:
  - `text-xs` or `text-sm`
  - `text-muted-foreground`
- Do not change row height drastically; keep it compact and scan-friendly.

==================================================
Constraints & checks
==================================================

- No backend or schema changes.
- Do NOT modify decision logic or AI/rules.
- Confirm:
  - Dashboard “Getting started” card appears only when there are zero employees and zero checks, and disappears once there is any data.
  - Employees list shows a clean TL;DR for each employee using existing data.
- Keep explanations in your answer short and focused on what changed.
